<div class="lead">
	<span class="accent">Accessibility</span> is not a feature. It's a fundamental right. We exist to ensure that everyone can experience everything.

	<span class="accent">No barriers. No exceptions.</span>

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Society speaks of empathy for disabled persons. It celebrates awareness months. It shares inspirational stories. Yet, when it comes to action, when it's time to build, to design, to create, accessibility remains an afterthought. A checkbox. A compliance requirement.

We find this unacceptable.

Every building with stairs but no ramp. Every app without screen reader support. Every public space designed for the "average" body. These are not oversights. They are choices. Choices that exclude millions from fully participating in the world they helped build.

## The Hidden Revolution

Here's what most people don't realize: the innovations that make life easier for everyone were born from accessibility.

The elevator. The typewriter. Voice recognition. Touch screens. Audiobooks. Even the smartphone keyboard you use every day. All originally designed for people with disabilities.

> "When we design for the margins, we create solutions that work for everyone."

This isn't charity. This isn't compromise. This is better design, period.

## Our Mission

We believe accessibility should be woven into the fabric of creation, not bolted on as a legal requirement.

- Technology that <span class="accent">adapts to humans</span>, not the other way around
- Experiences designed from day one to include, not exclude
- A world where disability is not a limitation, only bad design is

Axide exists to close the gap between intention and action. To transform empathy into engineering. To prove that accessible means better for all.

## Join the Movement

The path forward isn't about doing more for "them." It's about building a world that works for <span class="accent">everyone</span>.

We're not waiting for permission. We're not waiting for the industry to catch up. We're building now.

Because accessibility isn't the future. It's overdue.
