title: "Axide — Manifesto"

<p class="lead">
	This is where your journey begins. A lead paragraph that sets the tone for the entire manifesto. Use the <span class="accent">accent</span> class for emphasis on key words.
</p>

## The First Movement

Start writing your long-form content here. The typography is optimized for readability with a generous line height and Inter font. You can break your text into multiple paragraphs to maintain the "Silence Mode" philosophy—one section, one idea.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

> "A single powerful statement to break the rhythm of the text."

## The Diagonal Path

Use subheadings to organize your thoughts. The Space Grotesk font provides a technical yet dynamic feel to the headers.

- First key point of your manifesto
- Second point with <span class="accent">momentum</span>
- Third point that embraces the void

Continue your narrative here. The container width is restricted to ensure optimal line length for reading, surrounded by the "Silence" of the deep black background.

## Final Thoughts

Conclude your manifesto with a strong closing statement. The spacing between sections is generous (72px - 144px) to let each part of your message resonate.
